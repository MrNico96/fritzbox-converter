#Fritzbox converter :phone: :notebook: :arrows_counterclockwise:
Unfortunately Fritzbox does not offer the possibility to upload a csv with contacts, only an XML file. This small web page should help. <br>
*Tested with Fritzbox version 07.20.*

## How does it work?
On the web page you will see two tabs XML and CSV, each of which has the identical functions, i.e to upload, edit and download data.<br>
<br>
So you can first select a csv, then edit something else and afterwards download the XML. If you already have an address book as xml file, you can select it, edit it and convert it as csv.

*When you download the code, all you have to do is launch the index.html with a web browser.* <br>

*This is a redesigned and updated version based on [Soerenj Repository](https://github.com/soerenj/fritzbox_phonebook_convert_xml_csv_vcf/).*
